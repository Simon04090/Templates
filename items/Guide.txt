-Dust
You can open this in many editors besides Photoshop (GIMP, Pixelmator, etc.), although it may need slight editing to look right.

You can adjust the color overlay to change the color, and adjust the levels on the base layer for different 'grainy' looks.

-Ingot(Photoshop)
This is the version of the ingots that only works in Photoshop. It has all of the blending layers, so it's a bit of a mess but you can do more editing with the gradients and colors.

-Ingot(Universal)
This is the version of the ingots that works in programs other than Photoshop. You only have access to the layers, so if you want a different gradient you'll have to make your own the hard way.
