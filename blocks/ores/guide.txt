Studs layers can be colored and manipulated any way to make ores that appear differently.

Some ores have glow layers, which can be turned on and colored.

The "Cracks" layer adds cracks to whatever base texture is below it.

Switch the base texture to anything to change the material the ore is embedded in. (netherrack, end stone, gravel, even logs)

Available templates:
-Vanilla (Template for the primary ore)
-Gem
-Lump
-Infused
-Hamaczi
-Shards
-Quartz



How-To
The cracks were pulled from the vanilla ore texture through the use of stone set on the grain extract blend mode over the original ore textures. Removing the stone from the texture leaves behind the cracks on a neutral grey background. The resulting cracks can be applied to any texture using the grain merge blend mode.

Some textures with higher saturation, such as netherrack, become oversaturated when the grain merge cracks layer is applied. This can be fixed by duplicating the base layer and setting it to the saturation blend mode above the cracks layer. This sets all saturations beneath it to the levels of the original base.

By using the stone and cracks as grain extraction layers, the gold, diamond and redstone ores were reduced to reusable glow layers.

Lastly, ores belong on top of everything and are handled separately.

Have fun with the templates!
